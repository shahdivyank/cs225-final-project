## CS225: Spatial Computing Final Project

#### Winter 2025

#### Akash Devappa, Yusen Zhang, Divyank Shah

The code is provided as a Python Notebook for easy access and reproducibility. In order to run, open the notebook in VS Code, Google CoLab or similar and execute the cells. The notebook should not require any additional dependencies apart from the ones that are already included natively within Python.

#### Dataset Preparation

We assume that the tweets dataset has already been downloaded and unzipped. The dataset can be placed anywhere. You may reference the code to see the expected location or change this location to meet your needs

We do not provide the `.pkl` or `.json.gz` files as they are quite large. Instead we provide the code to generate these files as required. Running the cells should successfully generate these files and provide a simple query interface to benchmark the algorithms and its impact when fine tuning the various parameters.
